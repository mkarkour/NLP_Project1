# Natural Language Processing Project

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project, focused on analyzing reviews for restaurants and laptops. In this project, you will:

- Extract entities relevant to laptop reviews (such as software, electronic devices, etc.).
- Detect the sentiment or polarity of restaurant reviews (positive, negative, etc.).

## Project Overview

The project format consists of a guided Jupyter notebook, similar to the structure of exercise sessions. Additionally, the notebook includes questions where you are not required to write code but instead provide answers in English using Markdown cells. These questions are designed to assess your understanding of theoretical concepts, critical thinking abilities, and your capacity to provide clear explanations.

## Learning Objectives

A project in Natural Language Processing of this kind offers valuable learning opportunities:

- **Entity Recognition:** Gain hands-on experience in extracting relevant entities from text data, which is a crucial skill in various NLP applications.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Develop expertise in sentiment analysis, enabling you to determine the sentiment or polarity of text data, a skill with practical applications in fields such as customer feedback analysis and opinion mining.

- **Practical Application:** Apply NLP techniques to real-world data, preparing you for scenarios where you need to process and analyze large volumes of unstructured text data.

- **Critical Thinking:** The project questions encourage critical thinking and the ability to explain complex concepts clearly.

- **Communication Skills:** Practice communicating your findings and insights in English, an essential skill for data scientists when presenting results to stakeholders.

This project offers a holistic learning experience in NLP, equipping you with valuable skills that can be applied to various domains and industries.
